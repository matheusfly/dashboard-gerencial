# Local React Preview Setup: Finance Dashboard

## 1. Project Goal

The objective is to set up a local React development environment to build and preview a "Finance" dashboard component. This will serve as the foundation for the frontend of the Business Intelligence application, allowing for rapid, iterative development of the UI.

## 2. Technology Stack

-   **Framework:** React with Vite
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **Language:** JavaScript (JSX)
-   **Path Aliases:** We will configure `@/` to point to the `src` directory for cleaner imports.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Initialize React Project**: Create a new React project named `gym-bi-dashboard` using Vite.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Install `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`.
3.  **Configure Tailwind CSS**: Create and configure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`, and update the main CSS file.
4.  **Create Folder Structure**: Set up a `src/pages` directory to house our main page components.
5.  **Create Finance Page**: Create a placeholder page component at `src/pages/Finance.jsx`.
6.  **Update App Entrypoint**: Modify `src/App.jsx` to import and render the `Finance.jsx` page.
7.  **Run Local Server**: Provide the command to start the Vite development server for a live preview.

This focused plan will allow us to quickly get a visual and interactive version of the finance dashboard running locally.
